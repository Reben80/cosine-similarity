# Vector Similarity Game

## Description
Vector Similarity Game is an interactive web-based educational tool designed to help users, especially students, understand the concept of cosine similarity in vector mathematics. The game provides a visual and interactive experience to estimate the cosine similarity between two vectors in a 2D space.

## How to Play
- The game displays two vectors as dots on a 2D plane.
- Players estimate the cosine similarity between these vectors and enter their guess.
- The guess should be a number between -1 and 1, where 1 indicates identical vectors, 0 indicates orthogonality, and -1 indicates opposite vectors.
- The game consists of 5 rounds, and the aim is to make the most accurate guesses in each round.
- The score is calculated based on the accuracy of the guesses.

## Features
- Interactive 2D canvas to visualize vectors.
- Arrows indicating vector directions and a circle marking the origin.
- Input field for entering cosine similarity guesses.
- Scoreboard to track the player's performance.
- Instructions page explaining cosine similarity and how to play the game.
